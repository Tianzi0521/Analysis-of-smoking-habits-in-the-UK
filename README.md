# Analysis-of-smoking-habits-in-the-UK
The global health problem has always been a topic of great concern to people, and the diseases induced 
by smoking are gradually increasing. Out of this motivation, we study the demographic 
characteristics of smokers and how each factor affects the amount of tobacco they consume. We use a 
cross-sectional dataset containing 1691 observations from a smoking survey in the United Kingdom, 
which includes 12 variables such as the age of the smoker, the number of cigarettes smoked per day, 
gender, race, nationality, etc. We use several methods such as Linear Regression, Confidence 
Interval, Tree regression, and Hypothesis Test to evaluate the relationship between age and smoking 
frequency, the average age of Caucasian smokers, the average amount of cigarettes smoked per day on 
weekdays, etc. based on the sample data from the UK. 

## Data Description
The smoking habits of UK smokers are collected from some surveys and upload on the website OpenIntro 
(https: //www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=smoking). This data could be used for analyzing the 
demographic characteristics of smokers and how each factor affects the amount of tobacco they consume. 
The data set has 1691 observations on the following 12 variables: 
1. gender: Gender with levels of Female and Male.
2. age
3. marital_status: Marital status with levels Divorced, Married, Separated, Single and Widowed.
4. highest_qualification: Highest education level with levels A Levels, Degree, GCSE/CSE, 
GCSE/O Level, Higher/Sub Degree, No Qualification, ONC/BTEC and Other/Sub Degree
5. nationality: Nationality with levels British, English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Other, Refused and 
Unknown 
6. ethnicity: Ethnicity with levels Asian, Black, Chinese, Mixed, White and Refused Unknown.
7. gross_income:
Gross income with levels Under 2,600, 2,600 to 5,200, 5,200 to 10,400, 10,400 to 15,600, 15,600 
to 20,800, 20,800 to 28,600, 28,600 to 36,400, Above 36,400, Refused and Unknown.
8. region: Region with levels London, Midlands & East Anglia, Scotland, South East, South West, 
The North and Wales
9. smoke: Smoking status with levels No and Yes
10. amt_weekends: Number of cigarettes smoked per day on weekends.
11. amt_weekdays: Number of cigarettes smoked per day on weekdays.
12. type: Type of cigarettes smoked with levels Packets, Hand-Rolled, Both/Mainly Packets and 
Both/Mainly Hand-Rolled

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this study has provided significant insights into the demographic characteristics of smokers 
in the United Kingdom and their patterns of tobacco consumption. Our analyses, encompassing logistic 
regression, linear regression, and hypothesis testing, have elucidated several key findings.
Age, income, and marital status emerged as significant factors influencing smoking habits. Notably, 
younger individuals were more likely to smoke, contradicting our hypotheses. Those with lower income 
levels were more likely to smoke, aligning with our hypothesis that financial stress contributes to higher 
smoking rates.
Gender also played a crucial role, with males showing a higher propensity to smoke than females. This 
aligns with our hypothesis that social norms and biological factors might influence smoking habits 
differently across genders.
Interestingly, ethnicity had a less pronounced impact on smoking habits than anticipated. This finding 
suggests that while cultural factors may influence smoking initiation, other factors like socioeconomic 
status and personal circumstances might have a more direct impact on continued tobacco use.
